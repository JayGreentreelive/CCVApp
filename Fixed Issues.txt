Both:
	Implemented Note caching, reducing the frequency of downloading the Note when going back and forth between UI pages.

	Added auto-retry when a note download fails. Usually it's caused by a minor hiccup in the network, and a simple retry fixes it.
		This saves the user from having to see an error dialog and manually retry.

iOS
	The Nav Toolbar now works in landscape mode. (But not when watching a landscape video cause that sucks)
	Audio works with the volume switch off
	Automatically go to fullscreen when entering landscape and watching a video.
	Tapping on the news description text now correctly brings up the navbar.

Android
	The app no longer resets to the first page in a section when backgrounding / resuming.
	Fixed an issue causing the Springboard to stop working if back was pressed while Login/Profile/ImageCropping were open.

	Fixed an issue causing spellcheck to be on for news items.
