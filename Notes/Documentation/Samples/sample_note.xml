                He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? 
                To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

                You will not sure die, the serpant said to the woman. 
                For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, 
                and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.

                 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, 
                 but against the rulers, against the authorities, 
                 against the powers of this dark world and against 
                 the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenely realms.

    <Quote Citation="Jacob Riis">
        I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, 
        perhaps a hundred times without so much as a crack showing in it. 
        Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know 
        it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.
